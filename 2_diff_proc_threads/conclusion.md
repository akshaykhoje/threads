# Differences

- Each process has different memory while threads share memory.
- Since threads share memory, their arises a chance of overwriting and undesirable access to memory.


## Threads are just parallel **tracks of execution** within a process. They create an illusion of concurrency. Parallel execution is possible only with multiple processers(cores).
